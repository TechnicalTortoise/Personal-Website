				<h3>Duration - 2-3 days</h3>

					I originally made a basic potential flow simulator back in winter 2017, when I was supposed to be revising aerodynamics. While it was 
					technically procrastination, it did help me understand what was going on.
					For the uninitiated, potential flow theory is a relatively simple way to visualise and model fluid flows. It assumes the flow is inviscid, 
					steady, and incompressible.
					The simulation is written in python. It is structured such a flowspace object can be created, which can have various flow elements added
					to it. Streamlines, velocity potential lines, velocity and stagnation points can then be found and plotted.
					The main program and a few demonstrations can be found <a href="https://github.com/TechnicalTortoise/PotentialFlowSim" target="_blank">here</a>.

					Although the plane is indeed unmanned, the title isn't a typo, I just haven't named it yet.
					After my less than successful experience flying the professionally designed simple scout, I decided the best course of action would be to try
					and design my own plane. After some quick hand sketches, I drew up the aircraft in Solidworks:
					</br></br> <img src="images/personal projects/Unnamed Plane/2.png" alt="Unnamed Plane" class="center" width="800"> </br>							
					The main issue with the simple scout was the fixed wing position. This was a problem as the GC ended up too far back, making the plane
					very hard to fly. The new plane solves this by having a wing which can move along the fuselage.
					The wing is attached to the fuselage with some rubber bands, for easy adjustments. Some changes were made from the solidworks model,
					for example the ailerons, and the circular wingtips.
					</br></br> <img src="images/personal projects/Unnamed Plane/1.jpg" alt="Unnamed Plane" class="center" width="800"> </br>							
					All the electronics were salvaged from the simple scout.
					From designing the aircraft myself, as well as consulting a friend, I have made a few mistakes which I won't make again:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Always consider the lengths of wire on the servos. I placed the aileron servos too far from the center of
						the wing, meaning the cables would not reach the receiver. To counter this, I had to purchase some extension wires. This 
						adds mass and cost, but does work.
					</li>
					<li>
						Another mistake was the tail servo placement. They are far from the CG, and such their mass moves the CG back
						a significant amount. Next time, I will place the servos closer to the CG, and use longer control rods to actuate the control surfaces.
					</li>
					<li>
						I need to put more consideration into the design of the tail, such that the elevator and rudder do not collide when at maximum deflection.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The plane uses a few 3D printed components:
					<img src="images/personal projects/unnamed plane/3dprinted.png" alt="Unnamed Plane" width="100%">
				</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The control horns (left), are glued into the control surfaces, and are part of the mechanism that connects
							the servos to the control surfaces.
						</li>
						<li>
							The firewall (middle), is what the motor is screwed onto. The firewall is glued and taped to the front of the fuselage.
						</li>
						<li>
							The pushrod system used to attach the control horn to the servo. A wooden BBQ skewer is glued inside each of the pieces, to create
							the linkage. To secure to the servo, a drawing pin is placed through the piece on the right and through the servo arm.
							Similarly, to stop the left piece sliding out of the control horn, another drawing pin is used.
							This method is used as it reduces print time, and is extremely cheap and simple:
						</li>
					</ul>
					</br> <img src="images/personal projects/Unnamed Plane/mechanism.jpg" alt="Unnamed Plane" class="center" width="800"></br></br>
				<p>
					Most importantly, it actually worked!
					</br>
					After turning the sensitivity down to about 70%, it's much more controllable than my previous attempt, however is still a bit twitchy on the
					roll axis. I only crashed it once, but that's because of my poor piloting skills rather than poor design. Proof that it works at all:
					</br>
					<iframe width="1120" height="630" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BzbSHgg4hg0" frameborder="0" class="center" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					</br>
					In hindsight I should have waited until a less windy day, but it still survived.
					</br>
					And yes, the Wednesday frog on the front is necessary for ballast purposes..

					This was my first attempt at building an RC plane from scratch. It was designed by FliteTest, and the plans can be found 
					<a href="https://www.flitetest.com/articles/ft-simple-scout-build" target="_blank">here</a>.
					</br></br> <img src="images/personal projects/simple scout/Simple scout.jpg" alt="Simple Scout" class="center" width="800"> </br>
					The plane did techincally fly..
					</br></br> <img src="images/personal projects/simple scout/flying.png" alt="Simple Scout" class="center" width="800"> </br>
					Unfortunately, the plane suffered from an aft CG, making it very difficult to control, especially for a beginner.
					I also discovered afterwards that new pilots should always limit control surface movements to around 50%-80% of their highest values.
					After a few semi successful flights, it flew for its last time.
					</br></br> <img src="images/personal projects/simple scout/oof.jpg" alt="Simple Scout" class="center" width="800"> </br>
					Fortunately, all the electronics survived the crash, and could be repurposed for my next attempt. The fuselage was easy to tape up, 
					however it will never fly again. It now hangs on my wall as a reminder of things that could have been.

					In late February 2018, I decided I wanted a 3D printer, so I bought a cheap one from China, the Tronxy P802m.
					Including a 1kg spool of PLA filament, the total cost was about Â£150. Not bad if you ask me.
					After lots of assembly, and some required modifications, it was put together:
					</br></br> <img src="images/personal projects/3D printer/printer.png" alt="3D printer" class="center" width="800"> </br>
					One of the main issues to start, was the hole for the Y axis belt holder was in the wrong place. This meant some of the
					parts had to be at very awkward angles. Luckily, it printed just well enough for me to design and print a replacement part:
					</br></br> <img src="images/personal projects/3D printer/y holder.jpg" alt="3D printer" class="center" width="800"> </br>
					Another problem to start with was completely my own fault. The belts were far too loose so the prints were terrible.
					After proper tightening, prints started coming out decent:
					</br></br> <img src="images/personal projects/3D printer/cat.jpg" alt="3D printer" class="center" width="800">
					<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1545913" class="center" style="text-align: center;" target="_blank">Cali Cat</a>
					</br>
					After much more tweaks of settings, and proper bed levelling, the printer now performs well with an acceptable level 
					of reliability.

				<h3>Duration - 2 Weeks</h3>
				<p>
					After winter exams in 2017/18, I wanted to make something, and decided on a simple arduino powered clock.
					To start, I acquired a DS1307 real time clock (RTC) module. This is what actually keeps the time.
					Following that, I made a prototype with the resources I had (arduino kit provided by the university):
					</br></br> <img src="images/personal projects/clock/prototype.jpg" alt="Clock" class="center" width="800"> </br>
					Once I knew the concept could work, I figured out how to use the RTC module in the arduino code. I also purchased
					a large box of assorted LEDs and a few arduino nanos.
					</br>
					I then drew up a box in Solidworks, and laser cut the parts in the University workshop.
					After assembly, the internals looked like this (messy I know):
					</br></br> <img src="images/personal projects/clock/internals.jpg" alt="Clock" class="center" width="800"> </br>
					The final product looks like this:
					<table style="width:80vh">
						<tr>
							<th><img src="images/personal projects/clock/front.jpg" alt="Clock" width="550"></th>
							<th><img src="images/personal projects/clock/back.jpg" alt="Clock" width="550"></th>
						</tr>
					</table>
					</br>
					To tell the time, the top row reads the hours, middle row minutes, and bottom row seconds, in binary.
					The 2 buttons on the back are for adjusting the time. The clock is powered by a mini USB cable, plugged into the wall via
					a 5V adapter.
					</br> </br>
					If I was to do this project again, I would take more consideration with cable management. Designing and ordering a custom PCB
					would have made it significantly tidier, and less likely for loose connections to occur.
