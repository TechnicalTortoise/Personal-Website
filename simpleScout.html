                This was my first attempt at building an RC plane from scratch.
                It was designed by FliteTest, and the plans can be found <a href="https://www.flitetest.com/articles/ft-simple-scout-build">here</a>.

                Unfortunately, the plane suffered from an aft CG, making it very difficult to control,
                especially for a beginner. I also discovered afterwards that new pilots should always
                limit control surface movements to around 50%-80% of their highest values. After a few
                semi successful flights, it flew for its last time. 
                Fortunately, all the electronics survived the crash, and could be repurposed for my next attempt.
                The fuselage was easy to tape up, however it will never fly again. It now hangs on my wall as a
                reminder of things that could have been.
