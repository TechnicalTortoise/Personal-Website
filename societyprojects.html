			<h2> Soapbox Racers </h2>

				I am an active member and the treasurer of the university's soapbox racers society. Here I will try to post updates on
				our activity.

					Firstly I would like to apologise for the title of this update. More importantly, the soapbox actually has 4 wheels now, which is probably
					useful. Unfortunately we lost some of the parts for attaching the wheels, specifically one of the cones which holds the bearings in. We had to bodge around that 
					and use one of the wrong size, however it works as a temporary fix.

					We also realigned the steering as it had become offset by 90.

				<p>
					The main thing that's happened is we have moved the soapbox and all the stuff to my garage. This is because we 
					couldn't use the old one anymore, as the society member who's house it was has moved.
					We also decided that over the summer, the 2 of us which are here should try and finish the current soapbox,
					to start with a clean slate in September.
					</br>
					To start this, we built a steering "wheel", by which I mean drilling a hole through the steering column, 
					and pushing a threaded rod though, and securing with nuts. Steering bar is probably a more appropriate term.
					</br>
					The next things we need to do:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Thread the rear axles so we can attach the back wheels</li>
					<li>Trim down the steering column with a hacksaw as to not kill the driver in a crash</li>
					<li>Figure out what we're going to do about brakes</li>
					<li>Mount the back wheels with some sort of braking system</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Here's a nice picture from the build/move session. As it turns out I can't keep my eyes open for photos..
