                This project was in semester 1, year 2. Here I led a team of 5 in designing, building, programming,
                and testing a robot to drive around a preplanned course, dropping M&Ms in specific locations.
                I was the team leader, as well as the programmer. While I oversaw the design process,
                most of it was done by my team members.

            <p>
                On the assessment day, the robot followed the course perfectly, 
                however the M&M dispenser was incorrectly loaded, and we unfortunately 
                didn't get many good drops. Overall though, I would still deem the project a success.
