                I originally made a basic potential flow simulator back in winter 2017,
                when I was supposed to be revising aerodynamics. While it was technically procrastination,
                it did help me understand what was going on. For the uninitiated, potential flow theory is a
                relatively simple way to visualise and model fluid flows. It assumes the flow is inviscid,
                steady, and incompressible. The simulation is written in python. It is structured such a
                flowspace object can be created, which can have various flow elements added to it. Streamlines,
                velocity potential lines, velocity and stagnation points can then be found and plotted.
